# workDayScheduler
This is a simple online daily planner utilizing html, css, and javascript. The scheduler allows a user to plan out their day. The user can type into the text area and save the text to local storage. The user has the ability to clear the schedule using the button at the very bottom, which clears the local storage and reloads the page. Here is a link to the scheduler... https://jkthomps21.github.io/workDayScheduler/
